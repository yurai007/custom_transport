   Custom transport as simple library replacement for boost::asio.
   Under the hood simple TCP epoll server + callbacks.
   ref: http://byteandbits.blogspot.com/2013/08/tcp-echo-server-using-epoll-example-for.html

 * Event-driven design. State machine. The only place where we block is epoll_wait.

 * calloc = malloc + memset(0)
 * When I have client and I break server by SIGINT then I can't bind again by server.
   I get bind error: Address already in use. The reason is that socket (even closed on server side)
   is in TIME_WAIT state (for TCP by ~4 minutes). Remedium is using
   SO_REUSEADDR option for the socket by setsockopt (nc do that:)).
   ss -tan | grepc [port] - shows sockets in TIME_WAIT state

 * For TCP non-blocking write/read with EPOLLET (edge-triggered) mode
   1. TCP + EPOLLET guarantes that read always reads all available data so there is no sense to
      call read again in loop until return_code == -1 and errno == EAGAIN
      (We know that second call always return EAGAIN). Ref:
      http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html
      Without TCP we would be forced to doing that in while(true) because of
      edge-trigged mode (we must read all data,
      because we won't get notification again about same data. Next event will overrite old data) like here:
      https://banu.com/blog/2/how-to-use-epoll-a-complete-example-in-c/
      All I said before would be true but signals...
   2. Fortunately non-blocking call read/write guarantes that no interruption happen and no EINTR will
      be returned. Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14134440/eintr-and-non-blocking-calls

 * Ctrl+C -> SIGINT
 * Send return n bytes <-> n bytes were copyied to TCP/IP stack (a'ka sk_buffer)

   TO DO: what about iteration in resolving_name?
